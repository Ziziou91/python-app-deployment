1) Why create a python function for this? Is there more my function can be doing? Otherwise feels like an extra step/piece of complexity then I could just trigger the Jenkins pipeline with the webhook.
2) Would this be a good case for using an Azure function/Lambda? Feels like I could have something much lighter listening for the webhook, rather than a full VM.
